Caller was clearly just curious about the phone, what people use the operator line for, etc. We talked for a while, I had to ask them to speak up a few times as it was rather hard to understand them. I feel like this may have been a person I talked to at length before. I mentioned some of the features of the phone that they could experience through the directory. After I mentioned it, the caller was curious about the apology line, and wondered if they could be apologized to. I said that I didn't think that that was a feature but they suggested that that would be nice and that they would like it if that were a feature, that I should suggest it. They thought that maybe an apology from this service would make them feel better about something that they had never received an apology for. The caller then asked if I would apologize to them and I said that I wouldn't. They later apologized to me a few times and I almost ended up apologizing as well but managed not to. They closed by saying that they were sorry to take up so much of my time, I told them not to worry about it.

The same child called and said he needed the ghostbusters. When asked how many ghosts there were the child counted up to 16 ghosts. The child was told to run.

Caller was just generally excited about and interested in Futel. They are making their rounds to all the Portland phones, only have 2 left I think. We talked for a little while, they said they have all the zines and a t-shirt and have been meaning to donates some money. They also have interest in becoming an operator. One of the most pleasant operator calls I've fielded yet.

Caller asked the Operator for the phone number of an individual in another city.  Operator was not able to find this information readily on the internet but thanked the caller for using Futel.

Heard a recorded song, then the handset being hung up. Also, the buzz made the line sound like crap.
