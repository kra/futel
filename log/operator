Caller was clearly just curious about the phone, what people use the operator line for, etc. We talked for a while, I had to ask them to speak up a few times as it was rather hard to understand them. I feel like this may have been a person I talked to at length before. I mentioned some of the features of the phone that they could experience through the directory. After I mentioned it, the caller was curious about the apology line, and wondered if they could be apologized to. I said that I didn't think that that was a feature but they suggested that that would be nice and that they would like it if that were a feature, that I should suggest it. They thought that maybe an apology from this service would make them feel better about something that they had never received an apology for. The caller then asked if I would apologize to them and I said that I wouldn't. They later apologized to me a few times and I almost ended up apologizing as well but managed not to. They closed by saying that they were sorry to take up so much of my time, I told them not to worry about it.
