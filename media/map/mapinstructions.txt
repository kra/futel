How to update the InDesign map:
I use Stamenâ€™s OpenStreetMap toner tileset so that it is 1) creative commons and 2)  prints well.  Their map viewer has a built-in image export and embed functions:
http://maps.stamen.com/toner/

How to update the uMap embedded map:
add locations to umapfutel.csv

The map was built with my openstreetmap login (MathewL)
https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/futel-service-map_707873

there is an old map at this url but umap broke Github login:
https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/futel-service-map_551231
mathewlippincott has permissions, if they fix github login, Ican add you as an editor if you log in to uMap using your Github username

The icon uses this graphic
