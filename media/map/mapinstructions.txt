The current print/graphic map is in:
media/map/vector-map

The three indesign files contain the different maps to export. The maps are built up from illustrator assets in “assets.” update the assets then let indesign files relink. Export service-map.indd and service-map8-5x11.indd as print pdfs. Export service-map-web.indd adn Service-map as PNGs. 

There are additional icons in the “icons” folder. Screenshots of OSM map files that were traced are in “sources.”

How to update the uMap embedded map:

upload this file to uMap (link below) and check “replace layer content” on Layer 1

The map was built with my openstreetmap login (MathewL)
https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/futel-service-map_707873

there is an old map at this url but umap broke Github login:
https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/futel-service-map_551231
mathewlippincott has permissions, if they fix github login, Ican add you as an editor if you log in to uMap using your Github username

The icon uses this graphic

How to update the InDesign map:
I use Stamen’s OpenStreetMap toner tileset so that it is 1) creative commons and 2)  prints well.  Their map viewer has a built-in image export and embed functions:
