must have insurance
grant money can cover insurance

Metro requires that grantees provide proof of insurance coverage for the duration
of their grant. If you or your fiscal sponsor do not have insurance, grant money can
be used to purchase coverage and should be included in your applicationâ€™s
proposed budget. Insurance coverage must be in place before your contract can be
finalized. Insurance requirements include carrying commercial general liability,
auto coverage if vehicles will be used for grant-funded activities and workers compensation coverage if
your organization has paid employees and is subsequently required by law.
