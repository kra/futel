Post review with Dana Lucero:

reviewers liked:
solid and interesting
impactful to old town
good partnership - street roots and vendors
reclaiming unused property
cool creative thing

anything in old town is vulnerable, what is the plan for damage?
this should be explicit, sustainability
tie in to existing phones
refer to past work, nine years, 17 phones!
include testimonials from affected people, other voices
- artists
- unhoused people who were helped
- solicit statements!
can we get statements from people involved with this project?
- artists
- street roots community

application does have specifics about people and project, good

Images need more description. Connect words to supporting images, prime reviewers to look at images
"as you can see in the image, ..."

bounce ideas off Dana Lucero beforehand!


post discussion with Allie Morgan

probably needs more specifics
permitting?

staffing from SR and Futel
name artists beforehand?
one or more lead artists and SR picks from phone contributions?

is there an event that can be linked to it? Opening or celebration?

points to emphasize

helping to promote and drive patrons to new building
integrating with neighborhood
getting traffic to street roots, an established creative org
new media project for Street Roots
