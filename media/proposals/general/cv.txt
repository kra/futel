Church Of Robotron
2012 to 2015

The Church of Robotron is a collaborative series of immersive, interactive multimedia installations which present a cautionary message about machine superiority and human error. Effects include kinetic sculptures, whistles, percussion, vibration, ozone generators, electrical discharges, simulated fires, projected video of the current and previous participants, and live performances, all triggered by audience interaction. Installations are customized for the space and opportunity, and can include unattended public interaction at all hours performed by the audience touching a plate glass window or manipulating a ruggedized control.
