Mission

Futel is an art and social service organization which refurbishes salvaged payphones and telephony equipment and builds them into public installations. Our installations provide interactive audio art, free calls, live human interaction, and community engagement.

History

Futel has been active since 2014, with public installations continuously available since our first in June 2014

Programs

Futel currently has nine public installations in Portland and one installation in a venue. We provide telephony services and social program connectivity to Right To Dream Too and the Social Justice Action Center in Portland. We have three public locations outside of Portland. Futel provided over 10,900 free calls and thousands of interactions with several creative works in 2021.




I run a social service and art organization called Futel (http://futel.net), we install public phones that make free calls and have interactive art installations. I'm interested in talking about partnership, location, and funding possibilities. We've worked with the Village Coalition, RACC, Open Signal, and other groups and have been funded by grants for 6 years, and my usual strategy for funding is to find a partner for an installation tailored for a location, although Futel is always hungry for general operational support. I'd love to talk about partnership opportunities! Thanks!
