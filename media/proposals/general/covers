Futel is a social service and art organization which refurbishes salvaged payphones and telephony equipment and builds them into public installations. Our installtions provide free calls, live human interaction, community engagement, and interactive audio art. We have been active for eight years, currently have twelve public phones, and provided over 10,000 free calls in 2021.

I run a social service and art organization called Futel (http://futel.net), we install public phones that make free calls and have interactive art installations. I'm interested in talking about partnership, location, and funding possibilities. We've worked with the Village Coalition, RACC, Open Signal, and other groups and have been funded by grants for 6 years, and my usual strategy for funding is to find a partner for an installation tailored for a location, although Futel is always hungry for general operational support. I'd love to talk about partnership opportunities! Thanks!
