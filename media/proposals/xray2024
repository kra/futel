What are your goals for a partnership with XRAY?
Spots played on the air or other outreach for Futel, a low barrier communication oriented 501c3 org (https://futel.net). Also would like to explore future collaboration involving XRAY expertise, training, or equipment as part of a community oriented audio project involving public Futel installations and an identified community in Portland.
