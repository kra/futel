What are your goals for a partnership with XRAY?
Spots played on the air or other outreach for Futel, a low barrier communication oriented 501c3 org (https://futel.net). Also would like to explore future collaboration involving XRAY expertise, training, or equipment as part of a community oriented audio project involving public Futel installations and an identified community in Portland.


As an example, a project I'm currently trying to fund is a collaboration between Futel, Street Roots, and a creative writer. Futel will install an installation including a free public phone in front of the new Street Roots office and launch an interactive creative audio program. Street Roots will select participating artists, provide outreach and distribution, and provide meeting and work space, Street Roots and the creative writer will provide mentoring, editing, and artist and work selection. Futel will provide implementation, operations and practical mentoring.

XRAY could have many roles including audio equipment, practical and creative mentoring, outreach, and distribution.

This particular project will change as I try to adapt it to whatever grant I'm trying to use to fund it, we could talk about what aspects would be good for XRAY.

I'm usually trying to fund Futel with grants for lo-fi creative audio projects, or for providing free public phones, I would love to talk about outreach, distribution, and creative and practical support about any of them.
