2022 Creative Heights LOI

Instead of answering the LOI project questions in writing, you may record and submit some answers as a video (3 min max). Please note, you must still answer the other required written questions (starred). Please do not submit heavily edited videos or work samples, as the intent is to provide accessibility for those who feel better represented or understood via video versus in writing. Please submit a video OR write your answers. Do not do both, as only one will be reviewed.

Who do you want to work with?

Tell us about any proposed collaborators and their artistic/creative background, or how they'll support the project.

How is the proposed project different or distinct from previous work?
We are looking for elements of experimentation and artistic or curatorial evolution that keep an artist’s/organization’s work vibrant or relevant and may provide an artist/organization with the potential for learning and/or meaningful growth. That creative stretch can take many forms beyond bold artistic ideas, including size/scope of project, new development processes, unique collaborations and more. Generally, projects that primarily stretch administrative practices, or do not generate from a creative impulse will not be competitive.

Select a preliminary grant request range *
Please select one grant range based on your best guess. We are not requesting project or organization budgets as part of the LOI. OCF reserves the right to request financial information from an organization before inviting a project to apply.

    $10,000- $24,000
    $25,000- $49,000
    $50,000- $74,000
    $75,000- $100,000

Letters of support
Please upload a letter of support from key collaborators confirming their commitment to the proposed project, or executive leadership at the lead nonprofit. You may combine multiple letters from several collaborators into one document. This is not required for the LOI, but it can help the review committee understand the level of commitment or involvement from your proposed partners.
