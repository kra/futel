Requested funds will be used to install and maintain the phone and related IT hardware, and to provide services for its operation. EPAP grant funds will enable the in-kind donations, which are committed contingent to the installation being funded.

Amounts do not include money spent on other installations, although services are pooled for all installations. Amounts in this budget are from our current best estimates for installation and operation costs, based on previous installations and operations.

The payphone, pedestal, and spare are long-term assets, although they are expected to remain in use for this project for many years after the grant period.
