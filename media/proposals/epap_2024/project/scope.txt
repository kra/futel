City of Portland Outgoing Grant - Scope of Work

Expected Activities:

We will install, operate, and maintain a Futel installation on the east side NE Brazee St north of NE 108th Ave, accessible from the sidewalk at all hours through the end of the grant period and for years afterward.

Data Collection to Show Progress:

As with all Futel phones, all usage rates are monitored at the feature level by phone.

Outcome measures:

Outcomes will be evaluated based on usage metrics and user feedback and engagement collected by features of the installation.

Evaluation & Measurement: 

We will monitor the rate of usage for this installation at hourly to monthly resolution. For example, among all Futel phones in 2023, there were over 11,600 outgoing calls from a dialtone and 609 calls to the voice conference.  We expect this installation to be in the second quartile for rate of use compared to the other Futel installations.

Recognizing the importance of ongoing dialogue and responsiveness to community needs, our project includes mechanisms for feedback and engagement from all participants. This feedback informs our continuous effort to improve accessibility and inclusivity, ensuring our installations serve as equitable, patron-informed platforms for expression and connection. Feedback mechanisms include metrics of usage, prompts for the user to evaluate the service and describe how it could better serve the community, and live human interaction with Futel operators at the touch of a button.

Our project design and execution are guided by the need to provide equitable access to communication services, creative opportunities, and the expression of experiences and culture.

Major Milestones for Project:

- Site selection (completed)
- Site-specific features chosen and implemented (completed)
- Installation hardware collected and refurbished
- Installation and public availability
- Evaluation of metrics and usage at 6 months

Anticipated Timeline:

- Before May 2024: Independent of the project, ongoing larger Futel project operates, including outreach and development of IT and network.
- First 2 weeks of May 2024: Site planning with host, estimate time and materials.
- End of May 2024: Purchase hardware and materials, configure IT, finalize site planning. Deploy installation.
- June 2024-April 2025: Site is operational. Maintain, repair, and operate site and larger network of installations.
