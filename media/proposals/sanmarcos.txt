Today, I'm asking to see if there is any way we could get a Futel phone installed in the parking lot of Southside Community Center.
I am also a journalist who is willing to cover this story for your company as a market conduit into the Texas area.

I have $500 to put toward a device. The non-profit sponsor is the Southside Community Center, where the phone would be placed, including the Internet connectivity. The installation could be done by a local phone shop who refurbishes and installs old phones, such as pay phones.

We have received $10000 from a local corporation for the phone project. Is there anyway we could get more information on how to move forward. Instead of a payphone, we are planning to buy a phone like at a hospital or jail to install outside at a homeless shelter in town. Here is the link below:





Futel phone at Southside Community Center
Oct 10 2023

Futel and Southside Community Center will deploy a Futel telephone customized for SCC. Futel will implement outgoing and incoming VOIP service, which will be operational from January 2024 through December 2024. Futel will ship a SIP box to SCC before December 2024. SCC will provide all other hardware, including the telephone and enclosure. SCC will provide a sutable location for the SIP box, and will perform all on-site work including installation and upkeep. Futel will provide operations help over email and telephone calls.

The outgoing VOIP service will have features similar to existing Futel phones in other locations, including outgoing PSTN service and voice menus. The service will be customized by Futel to meet SCC requirements, subject to implementation requirements.

SCC will pay Futel $600, with half delivered by November 2024 and the rest delivered after the SIP box is received.
