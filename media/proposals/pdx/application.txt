# Project/work statement overview

The Futel installation will consist of four payphones and several wall panels installed in the exhibition area.

The payphones are salvaged, working models which have been previously deployed as payphones, mounted on pedestal or wall enclosures. Users can interact with them using the handset and keypad, and each will function differently. Functionality will include:
- A voice menu tree similar to the menus provided for Futel's Portland installations, customized for Portland International Airport, the people travelling through it, and the concourse workers. As with the existing Futel installations, there will be approximately 100 menu options total, which will include free phone calls, directories of interesting and important numbers, audio art, and live operator interaction at some hours
- A dial tone, which will provide free phone calls to North America
- An interactive audio work, "Crossed Wires", where two or more participants try to communicate while their voices are distorted algorithmically
- An interactive audio work, "Give Me Central 209", where two or more participants try to communicate with each other and an AI participant when their voices are replaced and translated by an AI program

The wall panels will describe the Futel project and its impact with maps, photographs, and essays, displaying content from eight years of Futel publications in large formats suitable for attracting a walking traveler. Content may include:
- A map of current public Futel installations in Portland, Detroit and Ypsilanti, Michigan, and Long Beach, Washington
- Logs of calls to the Futel operator service over eight years
- Photographs of public Futel telephone and hygiene installations, and the salvage and engineering activities that support the project
- Essays on the motivations of the Futel project and the social and artistic movements which inspire it
- Reproductions of Futel signs and banners, and posters and flyers from installations and exhibitions

All interactive installations will be operational at all times during the exhibit. All content will be appropriate for a public setting serving a diverse all-ages audience.

# Objectives and expected outcomes

The initial response from many travellers upon seeing and approaching the installation will be one of curiosity and interest. The payphones will be familiar to millennials and older generations, but incongruous. They are anachronistic and perhaps nostalgic, prompting some viewers to wonder if this is a history exhibit or a discussion of the topic of urban amenities and their social impact.

Viewers who choose to interact with the installations will experience the Futel menus, dial tone, and audio works. They may explore the menus to understand what Futel phones can do and how they are used by people in Portland and other cities, or hear essays spoken by noted telephone network experimenters and hackers, or participate with interactive artistic programs.

The large wall panels will draw some viewers in, and provide another way to experience the work. The payphones and panels are complimentary, and each can be experienced without the other.

# Impact and external interactions

The telephone enclosures can be mounted on pedestals or attached to walls. Pedestal mounts must have a floor to be securely bolted to, alternately a thin platform can be provided. Wall mounts must have a solid wall to be securely bolted to. All artwork is accessible with mobility devices.

The telephone installations require power and internet connectivity at all times. Power requirements are 12 watts, 0.5 amps for all installations when in use. Connectivity requirements are access to the Futel servers using either a wired or non-public secure WIFI connection. Bandwidth requirements are 300 kbps for all installations when in use.

Mechanical or structural maintenance is not anticipated. Cleaning, sanitation, and other site upkeep can be performed as for similar public airport surfaces.

# Artist bio

Karl Anderson is a social practice artist in Portland, Oregon. For 30 years, he has been building, destroying, and rebuilding creative works related to themes of salvage, obsolescence, waste, and utility. Most of his artistic output is experienced in public urban settings and adapts to interactions with unprepared participants or witnesses. He has deployed public payphones in Portland and other cities for nine years as the director of Futel. With the Church of Robotron, he has built a series of travelling post-apocalyptic training facilities, indoctrination centers, and reading rooms based on the tenets of a coin-operated video game. With C.H.U.N.K. DCLXVI, he has created amphibious human-powered vehicles out of discarded bicycles and construction debris, often using them to spontaneously intervene in urban situations or destroying them in public spectacles.
