Futel Installation at Portland International Airport Project Statement

# Overview

The Futel installation will exhibit art and artifacts from the Futel project. It will illustrate the philosophy, motivations, aesthetic and impact of the Futel project over ten years in Portland, Detroit, and other cities.

The installation will consist of four payphones and several wall panels. The payphones will provide interactive audio art and services, and will be artistic and functional artifacts in their own right. The wall panels will showcase photographs, essays, and illustrations from ten years of the Futel project and its related publications.

The payphones will be working models which have been previously deployed as payphones, mounted on pedestal or wall enclosures. Users will interact with them using the handset and keypad, and each will function differently. Functionality will include:
- A voice menu tree similar to the menus provided for Futel's Portland installations, customized for Portland International Airport, the people travelling through it, and the workers who use the exhibition area. As with the existing Futel installations, the menu tree will contain approximately 100 menu options, which will include directories of interesting and important telephone numbers which can be called, audio art, and live operator interaction at some hours
- A dial tone, which will provide free phone calls to North America
- An interactive audio work, "Give Me Central 209", where two or more participants can try to communicate with each other and an AI participant when their voices are replaced and translated by an AI program

The wall panels will illustrate the Futel project ad its impact with photographs, essays, art, and maps. Content will be drawn from ten years of Futel publications, printed in large formats suitable for attracting a walking traveler. Content may include:
- A map and directory of current public Futel installations in Portland, Detroit, and other cities
- Logs of interesting calls to the Futel operator service over ten years
- Creative writing and illustration related to the Futel project
- Photographs of Futel telephone installations, and the salvage and engineering operations that support the project
- Essays on the motivations of the Futel project and the social and artistic movements which inspire it
- Reproductions of Futel signs, banners, and flyers from installations and exhibitions

All interactive installations will be operational at all times during the exhibit. All content will be appropriate for a public setting serving a diverse all-ages audience.  All content will be accessible to people with mobility devices. Content creators will include Karl Anderson, Debbie Wager, and Mathew Lippincott.

# Objectives and expected outcomes

The initial response from many travellers upon seeing and approaching the installation will be one of curiosity and interest. The payphones will be familiar to millennials and older generations, but incongruous. They are anachronistic and perhaps nostalgic, prompting some viewers to wonder if this is a history exhibit or a discussion of the topic of urban amenities and their social impact.

Viewers who choose to interact with the installations will experience the Futel menus and audio works. They may explore the menus to understand what Futel phones can do and how they are used, or hear essays spoken by noted telephone network experimenters and hackers, or try interactive artistic programs.

The large wall panels will draw viewers and provide another way to experience the work. The payphones and panels will compliment each other to create a multimedia experience, but each can be enjoyed without the other.

# Impact and external interactions

The telephone enclosures can be mounted on pedestals or attached to walls. Pedestal mounts can be securely bolted to the floor, or alternately a base can be provided. Wall mounts can be securely bolted to the wall.

The telephone installations require power and internet connectivity at all times. Power requirements are 12 watts, 0.5 amps total for all installations when in use. The installations require internet connectivity and must be able to access the Futel servers using either a wired or private secure WIFI connection. Bandwidth requirements are 300 KBPS total for all installations when in use. If either power or connectivity are interrupted, the audio installation functionality will be restored when the power or connectivity are.

# Artist bio

Karl Anderson is a social practice artist in Portland, Oregon. For 30 years, he has been building, destroying, and rebuilding creative works related to themes of salvage, obsolescence, and public space. Most of his artistic output is experienced in public urban settings and adapts to interactions with unprepared participants or witnesses. He has deployed public payphones in Portland and other cities for ten years as the director of Futel. With the Church of Robotron, he has built a series of travelling post-apocalyptic training facilities, indoctrination centers, and reading rooms based on the tenets of a coin-operated video game. With C.H.U.N.K. 666, he has created amphibious human-powered vehicles out of discarded bicycles and construction debris, often using them to unexpectedly appear in urban situations or destroying them in public spectacles.
