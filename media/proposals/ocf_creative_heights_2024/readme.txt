todo:
- we need partial matching funds from some source, this part is essential
- if we can get a collaborator with a name they can look up, it would help a lot
- should list staff or at least positions

$10,000-$100,000
Big grant. In 2023 smallest was $26K, a few $50K, a few up to $100K.
Awarded funds can be used for up to two years from the distribution date.

Need "letters of support from key collaborators".

If we can get a collaborator who they can look up, it will be competitive, this is BS:
"Engage artists, curators and collaborators of high caliber and achievement in their field. Demonstrate concepts and practices that are substantive, clearly articulated, and grounded in a deep knowledge of the artists field."

"culture bearers, tradition keepers or cultural organizations working with traditional art forms or other cultural forms of expression"

We need some matching funds of some kind:
"OCF is willing to fund the majority of the project budget."
