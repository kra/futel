In terms of your original goals, how successful was this project?

The project was succesful, with a wide audience. Between January 15 and December 3, there were:

1986 handset pickups (which start Hold The Phone) at the Open Signal phone
(averaging about 5.5/day)
358 selections of Hold The Phone from the incoming number
264 selections of Hold The Phone from other Futel phones

1951 selections of the Conversations project
185 selections of the Missed Connections project
122 selections of the Peoples Homes project

Users explored several interactive aspects of the projects, along with other incidental features of the phones, including 387 outgoing calls placed from the Open Signal phone.

If you need more space to describe, you are welcome to upload additional informatio
n along with your other documentation.

What were the unforeseen challenges and lessons learned from this Project Grant?

Hosting kiosks accessible to the public during the onset of a pandemic was challenging. We met this by quickly augmenting our installations with public hygiene facilities and a sanitation program.

If your final expenditures differed significantly from your proposed budget, please explain.

We spent money and labor building public hygiene facilities and implementing a sanitation program to ensure the safety of the users of our installations during the un
expected onset of the pandemic.
