Futel provides 1-20 VOIP hardware setups to connect with the Futel network. Hardware is provisioned with incoming and outgoing calls and service for a predetermined period. Service has Futel-style menus and features with customization appropriate for locations, developed in collaboration with you (eg menus, destinations, interactive features). You provide telephones and all other installation hardware. This option doesn't involve any backend work from you, only content collaboration and whatever installations you want to design.

Futel develops systems to enable junior software engineer workers, working with Futel engineers, to customize and deploy telephone services using Futel backends. Services might include playing pre-recorded sounds, accepting touch tone input, providing calls to preselected numbers, recording, providing dialtone for outgoing calls, connecting phone users to banks of operators at their personal phones, etc. Examples are menus, directories, audio zines with input from callers, operator assistance, etc. Engineers might customize, test, and deploy using Python, Javascript, Lua, and structured textfile, web GUI configuration, and others. Implementation might use Asterisk, Twilio services, and others.

Futel provides mentorship and training to junior software engineer workers to learn how to install, test, customize, and deploy an installation using the same technology as current Futel systems. This option doesn't include any working deliverables; we can provide mentoring services (eg office hours over Zoom and email) and a list of techniques, skills, and technologies that will be taught (engineering and operations practice, Linux/Virtualbox/DigitalOcean, Asterisk/VOIP, and other fields) but this would be mentoring, not something like a capstone project.
