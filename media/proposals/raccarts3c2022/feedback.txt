proposal was strong
just below the cutoff
reviewers knew about the project

give background
- what is the history and impact of the project
narrow the focus
- application was confusing because it was maintenance, spare/experimental build, professional devel, artistic devel
- what are the top needs
be direct about what it will be used for
- professional development was confusing
  - what exactly will be gained
  - this is a challenge because it's talking software to non-tech people. Probably don't say "evaluate", just "develop"
    - maybe talk about goals and then skills to reach goals?
  - implementation of professional development was confusing
    - first because the labor was muddled
    - having X hours for installation labor and X hours for engineering learning labor
    - be specific when funding hours for learning, I said "engineering time to ... and creative time to ...". Say "support X hours devoted to learning technology skills... to support <goal>" or "support X hours devoted to developing an artistic program to incorporate <technique> in future projects"

access is good
- it's OK to say we also want to give out free calls
- she remembers an earlier application where I said they get to experience a creative thing when they were doing something they needed to do
- someone gets art when they might not otherwise
