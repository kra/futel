Futel currently has nine public installations in Portland and one installation in a venue. We provide telephony services and social program connectivity to Right To Dream Too and the Social Justice Action Center in Portland. We have three public locations outside of Portland. Futel provided over 10,900 free calls and thousands of interactions with several creative works in 2021.
