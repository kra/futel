Since the system draws ~10W, the charger probably needs to be at least 2 amps to charge and run the equipment at the same time. 6+ amps would charge that 60Ah battery in 10 hours-12 while running, which seems like a reasonable goal.

9 amp: gl-inet, pap, franklin charging
7 amp: gl-inet, pap, franklin charged
4 amp: gl-inet, pap
