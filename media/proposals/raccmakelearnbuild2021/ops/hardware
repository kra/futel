For temporary connectors, I’d put a short length of heavy gauge wire on each screw terminal and then use electrical nuts to connect them, like with AC fixture wiring. If you need something real fast then maybe borrow some jumper cables from your trunk or get some heavy duty alligator clips at URS.

 If there are a lot of incoming/outgoing connections to be permanently connected, then we should get an electrical box with bus bars (two heavy duty copper bars with a bunch of screw terminals). They should have a good one at URS, I’d imagine. Sorry I didn’t plan for this, I thought we were only going to have the solar charger and 5V regulator directly connected. I saw a heavy duty bus bar setup at a surplus shop a couple weeks ago and nearly grabbed it.

Since the system draws ~10W, the charger probably needs to be at least 2 amps to charge and run the equipment at the same time. 6+ amps would charge that 60Ah battery in 10 hours-12 while running, which seems like a reasonable goal.
