## Objectives:

One or more usable demonstration installations.

Installation consists of a telephone which can be operated without wall power or wired internet. Internet can come from a cell hotspot, power can come from a solar panel or wall power.

Battery can be charged with wall power.
Battery can be charged with solar panel.
Installation is usable with wall or battery power.
Fully charged battery is usable for XXX hours without charging.
Installation is portable, for example a luggable box or a pedestal on a hand truck.
Installation is semi-secure and can be deployed without direct attendant, for example at an event or in an unattended lobby during working hours.

# Measuring charge

Checking the voltage should give you a decent estimate, as lead acid batteries have a consistent voltage decay as they lose charge, from about 13v-14v down to 10-11.
Our goal is to keep the batteries between 80 and 20 percent charge.
Measuring the total amp hours would have to be done by drawing the battery down under a consistent load. A lightbulb is good for that-- can you borrow a headlight off a vehicle? 
 100% charge/discharge is going to run the battery down in a few dozen cycles, but it should still last a month or so. The batteries aren’t that expensive and are very recyclable, so I wouldn’t feel bad about wrecking a few for demo purposes. If you can cut power at 11v or so, you’ll keep it going a lot longer.
