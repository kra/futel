In terms of your original goals, how successful was this activity?

The project was largely successful and we accomplished most, but not all, of our goals.

With the support of the grant we were able to design and iterate on installations with new capabilities. We built a working, portable installation, powered by a battery with an integrated charger and with cellular internet, which can operate for a day after charging. We also built a bench demonstration of a solar powered installation, and designed a frame to incorporate it into a movable or permanent housing.

The new installation, capabilities, and knowledge will expand the locations where we can deploy our work. We are using this to to strengthen our proposals and seek more flexible locations for future installations.

We were not able to build a working solar powered installation which is ready to deploy, but the bench demo proves the concept and demonstrates everything but the solar panel housing.

What were the unforeseen challenges and lessons learned from administering this activity and grant?

An unexpected challenge involved the requirements of securely housing solar panels. Because our installations use salvaged phone booths which may need repair, but almost no structural improvements, we did not realistically estimate the work and costs involved in building a stable housing for the solar panel size we needed.

We had to make several purchases of small components, including battery chargers, before finding one that was suitable for our usage patterns. This wasn't unforeseen, but the lesson learned is to avoid making assumptions when planning around unfamiliar components.


How did the final activity budget compare to what you originally proposed?

The project went slightly over budget, but the project was worthwhile and will be very positive for our future artistic prospects. We reduced wages as can be seen by comparing the report budget with the proposal budget.
