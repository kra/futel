categories:

Research and development. Projects in this category are projects that are advancing the state of the art in amateur radio and communication  science & technology.

goals:

Broad reach. Our best grants will benefit the widest community possible. We want to see that your grant will not only benefit your organization or community, but may also be cheaply replicated more broadly throughout society.

Social over commercial benefit.
Inclusion of underrepresented groups.

Empowerment of individuals, and distribution rather than centralization. Innovation by individuals and a community mindset are both at the heart of amateur radio. They are also core to our mission at ARDC. We prioritize projects that empower individuals and small organizations. ARDC-funded projects enable and encourage public distribution – rather than centralization – of tools, knowledge, and access.

Preservation of the right to innovate,

all technology, documentation, and other materials produced using ARDC funds must be made freely available to the public.

As you design your project, keep in mind the following to help us understand what you want to do:

    What will you do if you get the grant from ARDC? What is the project’s end result
    Why do you want to do this project? How will this project make your community or the world a better place?
    Who will carry out the work? Does your team have the capabilities to do the work? If not, who could be added to the team?
