In terms of your original goals, how successful was this activity?

We successfully used grant funds to operate eight existing, and one new, public installations for the year.

I successfully used grant funds for 80 hours of my time to evaluate and prototype systems to replace some of Futel's development and operations software. This has increased the artistic ability and robustness of the project and reduced ongoing expenses. I made a demo based on services by Twilio, Amazon AWS, and Digital Ocean. I then implemented part of the Futel system with the new services. Building on this work, I am continuing to convert the Futel implementation to the new services.

I successfully used grant funds for 80 hours of my time to develop creative projects. I prototyped several projects for Futel installations, involving AI transcription and speech synthesis from Google and human language interaction from OpenAI. One prototype was included in an interactive installation at the Teardown conference at the PSU CETI Community Technology Lab.

What were the unforeseen challenges and lessons learned from administering this activity and grant?

The fiscal sponsor lost their 501c3 status, causing some income to be delayed until their status is re-applied or we find a new sponsor.

How did the final activity budget compare to what you originally proposed?

We added one phone above what we expected, and saved IT expenses with the new processes. Donations were disrupted when the fiscal sponsor lost their 501c3 status, causing some income to be delayed until their status is re-applied or we find a new sponsor.
