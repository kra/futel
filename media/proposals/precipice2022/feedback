When discussing your proposal, one panelist expressed that they would have liked to see more consideration of how this project could or would possibly diversify accessibility to, participation in, and representation of the Portland street art scene. I’d recommend being more specific about what street artists you’d like to work with for the project, in other words, who exactly is talking about their experiences in street art, and what sort of story or advice are they communicating? It’s also important to then think of who will engage with this work, depending on installation location, accessibility, and pull.
