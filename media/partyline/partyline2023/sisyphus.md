# Druids of Sisyphus Gardens Log

- **2/10 vm.** Hello my personal teleportation device has apparently left me in Portland, Oregon in the year 2022 it is approximately.. *click*

- **3/16** “Hello.” “Hi.” “Just love your service and wanted to thank you or someone for this phone.” “Cool thanks for using it, where are you calling from?” “Um, Portland on Taylor, yeah I just have a burner phone and this Futel is just great.” “Thanks have a good night.”

- **4/8 vm.** The prisoners have escaped from sub-unit 4 alpha! Please initiate aerial search immediately! ...Just kidding this is a prank.

- **4/10** Caller and I said “hi.” ”hello.” to each other 4 or 5 times. Caller said traffic was really loud, but was happy to have a new Futel in the neighborhood by a church near Halsey and 39th or something. We talked about the weather and Party Line zine. Caller said they were the printer. Wished each other great days.

- **4/28 vm.** Keep pushing those trees up that hill.

- **5/28** Operator called. Whole family has covid! Best sounding/clearest Futel call ever. Hope those phone sanitation stations are still active. Save the human family!

- **6/26** Caller laughing throughout the entire call. “Who’s this?” “The Druid of Sisyphus Gardens.” “What is this?” “A free phone you can call anyone for free, are you in Portland?” “Free, I just put in a dime.” “You didn’t have to.” “Why would anyone need this?” “Not everyone has a cell phone.” “How does anybody make money off this?“ “Well it’s a nonprofit.” “That’s how you make money, nonprofit.”

- **6/26** “Hi who did I get?” “The Druid of Sisyphus.” “Oh cool, I’m in Detroit and it’s actually hot.” “It’s hot here too.” “Oh where are you?” “Southern Oregon.” “Ah, I’ve been to Shakespeare in Ashland.” “Yeah that’s relatively close.” “I’m really stoked about a working street phone. They just took out the last working pay phone in New York.” “Yeah I heard.” “Well have a great day.” ”you too.”

- **6-30** A highschooler was looking for Druidic advice. We spoke of school, hiking, and taking time out for friends.

- **7/17** Detroit caller asked if this was the Druid & I affirmed that it was. It was 89• there and 90• here. we talked more about weather and fire. “Ok.”

- **8/9** Portland caller wanted to visit. I asked if they knew anything about here or was a random caller. They just knew about it from Futel and were afraid of the internets, & hates driving on I-5. I gave them instructions anyway & said that so far none of the random callers have made it here. They sounded excited to try, but had to go cause their friend wanted to jet. (As of 12/22 they haven’t showed up.)

- At some point in here I got a secret way to call the Upright Futel phone and some time later randomly did so just moments after it had been fixed. The operator was confused, then they confused me, and then a mob of customers entered.

- **9/?** Caller wanted to come to our Druid meditation retreat thought it was maybe in Forest Park. I could not supply further wisdom or information to their many inquiries. They asked if they could call a priest instead.

- **9/25 vm.** Who are you? Followed by ipanema for a minute.

- **11/5** Caller was looking for Brad. I asked them why? They were told Brad was the one with knowledge. “Sorry I don’t know the Brad you’re looking for.” They told me a long poem and asked what I was doing? “Chilling with my sweetie.” Asked about my favorite things to do. I talked about building animal habitat sculptures. Caller was stoked and thanked me for doing that, then started in on some joke workshopping for a future open mic stand up, and then into another long poem. Then asked me to send them money. I said “no way.” They wanted to volunteer. I directed them to the website.

- **11/5** Same caller regaled the Druids on our party line. (a new feature/ I added another phone to the kitchen). While the Futel line was also constantly calling another number that nobody ever answered. Caller said they pressed over 30 buttons before reaching us.

- **11/5** Same caller spoke to the Druids on our party line while drinking vodka. Told us the same poems and jokes and about there health issues and many other things. I thought these calls automatically hung up after 15 minutes.

- **11/5** Same caller though I was a different operator, or whatever. Said they had just talked to two people out in the woods, asked if I minded if they drank then started in on the same jokes asked if I wanted to hear a poem. I said no and hung up.

- **11/5** Possibly same caller. Picked up receiver, then hung it up.

- **11/11** Caller asked “who is this?” “The Druid of Sisyphus Gardens.” “I was trying to call myself.” “I am not you.” “Are you sure?” “No, but that would be really weird.” I started to explain what I thought was the misconnection with their true self, but they handed the phone to their friend and so I explained it to them and then they explained it telephone style to them/me/us and said “thanks.”
