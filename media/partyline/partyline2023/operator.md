# Operator Log

Five operators logged 18 calls in 2022. Futel's hard-working operators need to be reminded about the importance of logging for outreach and maintenance! 434 operator calls were made, but that includes callers who didn't wait for an operator to be available, or who were just too boring to say anything memorable, so we can't blame the operators for everything. However, they are the only identifiable parties involved, so nobody else can be held responsible.

- **2022-01-01** Caller saw a payphone, just had to pick it up.
- **2022-01-08** Caller asked for the listing of their lawyer and provided a name.  After more information, provided the number for Multnomah County Circuit Court, Downtown Main Courthouse - High Volume Case Processing.
- **2022-01-09** Caller wanted the number for the Multnomah County Courthouse. I looked it up and they wrote it down. We talked a little longer after that.
- **2022-1-18** Heard only a loud buzzing on the line after connecting with the call and giving my Operator greeting.  Announced myself a few times and heard a faint echo of my words, but eventually ended the call.
- **2022-02-24** I could only hear strange buzzing static.  I told the caller to hang up and try again if they could hear me.  Then I somehow got transferred to the main Futel menu.  I hung up, but then took another operator call from another phone two minutes later: same thing. I used the legacy network (SMS) to escalate the issue.
