Your Billing Information
Freewire is providing this service free of charge as a courtesy to your organization.

How to connect to your Freewire Enterprise Internet Service
Your service has been provisioned on an auto-negotiating Fast-Ethernet port. If you would like the port hard-coded to a
certain speed/duplex just let us know.
Our Enterprise Internet Service gives you full IP connectivity via the Freewire network out to the Internet. To use it, simply
plug your router, firewall, or computer in to the Freewire Ethernet port and configure your device(s) with the IP address
information below.
IPv4 Address(es): 67.23.197.190
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.252
Default Gateway: 67.23.197.189
DNS 1: 67.23.194.121
DNS 2: 208.75.40.225
Note: IPv4 address exhaustion is approaching quickly. Soon the IPv4 Internet will cease to grow and all new business will
require IPv6 addressing. One consequence of this exhaustion is that IPv4 addresses available for use have almost all
been used previously. Because of that you may want to check with several spam black-list resources to ensure that your
block is “clean” if you intend to use it for outgoing mail via SMTP.
DNS Services
We can provide basic DNS services. For DNS requests please contact us at support@gofreewire.com
Post-Install Survey
We have attached a brief survey so that we can better serve our customers. Please take a moment to fill it out and send it
back to us along with your signed service-acceptance sheet and we'll send you a $25 Starbucks gift card as our way of
saying thank you. You can either fax it to us at 503-614-8283 or email a scanned copy to support@gofreewire.com.
Thank you for your business.
